# Welcome to the Probot Documents

ProBot is a highly configurable, multipurpose bot for greeting images, detailed logs, social commands, music, moderation, self-assignable roles, social media notifications, and protection.

This document will explain in detail how to use and set up each feature, as well as how to fix any problems that may arise.

By clicking on a module's name in the sidebar on the left, you will be immediately redirected to that module's configuration page.

## Settings

All commands will be configured via dashboard, with multiple options for each command setting.

> `Alias:` This is a customizable alias for a command. It could be a number, a letter, a word, or anything else.

> `Enabled Roles:` This option limits who can use the command to the roles you choose. Only people with those roles can run the command.

> `Disabled Roles:` This option prevents roles from using the command and prevents users with the corresponding role from using it.

> `Enabled Channles:` This option forces the bot to respond to the command in the specified channel.

> `Disabled Channles:` This option stops the bot from responding in the chosen channel. If you type a command in a channel other than the ones that are disabled, the bot will respond.
