# Dashboard

We do not use the old method of command configuration because it is both complex and time-consuming. Consequently, you will frequently configure stuff via the dashboard, as all actions and modules can be configured via the dashboard.
 
## How To Access The Dashboard
 
- Navigate to the [website](https://probot.io/) and click login to access your account and manage your server.
After logging in, a dashboard button will appear on the same page; clicking it will take you to the dashboard.

:::caution

You need the `Administrator` permission to display a specific server in the list.

## Settings

Every module includes a switch button in the upper-right corner, which can disable all of the commands included within that module. In addition, each command features a switch button that disables only that command and an edit button that provides a variety of choices that may be used to optimize workflow.

:::info

> **Alias**: This is a command's customizable Alias, which allows you to create a command shortcut. It could be a number, a letter, a word, or other characters.
>> All aliases must be distinct, and you must have a different Alias for multiple commands.

> **Enabled Roles**: This option limits who can use the command to the roles you choose. Only people with those roles can run the command.
 
> **Disabled Roles**: This option prevents roles from using the command and prevents users with the corresponding role from using it.
 
> **Enabled Channels**: This option forces the bot to respond to the command in the specified channel.
 
> **Disabled Channels**: This option stops the bot from responding to the chosen channel. If you type a command in a channel other than the ones that are disabled, the bot will respond.
 
> **Auto-delete with message deletion**: This option deletes the bot's response if the sender deletes their command message.
 
> **Auto-delete command invocation message**: This option deletes the command invocation message sent by the sender immediately after sending.

> **Auto-delete bot's reply message after 5 seconds**: This option deletes the bot's reply 5 seconds after the initial send time.

:::caution

If you can't see the server, it indicates that you do not have the `Administrator` permission required for full dashboard access.
Having a role named `Admin` or `Administrator` does not give you dashboard access, and the `Administrator` permission must be explicitly granted in your role setting.
