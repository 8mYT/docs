# Premium

On this page, you will find a whole explanation of our premium bot process, including what our premium bots offer, the available tiers, how to configure the bot, the payment cycle, how to invite the premium bot and troubleshoot issues while inviting, and a faq about premium bots that we've seen our premium users ask frequently.

## Premium Plan

Our plans are dedicated to big server owners looking to boost their servers with advanced features and protection to minimize the raiders and vandals. 

Our service offers two distinct premium tiers with a unique assortment of features.

## Premium Tier 1 

This bot is the first tier of the premium plan we have. Usually, decent-sized servers prefer this bot as it has multiple functions at a reasonable cost. 

The features that this tier provides are written in the following table:

- Protection
- Temporary Link
- Voice Online
- Adjust the Music Volume
- Executioner in logs
- Auto-role for a specific invite link.

:::info

- You cannot change or edit anything for the bot preferences since this bot is used in multiple servers by different users.

:::

:::caution

- You cannot change the bot's invite link, so be careful while using it and do not share it with anyone else!

:::

## Premium Tier 2

This bot is the second-tier plan, the most likely preferred by big servers.

The features that this tier provides are written in the following table:

- All Tier 1 Features
- Anti-raid
- Personalized bot, custom bot username, avatar, status, and exceptional command you may find in [here] ()

:::info

- You cannot use an optional bot token. 

:::

## Manage Premium

Premium has a dedicated page where you can manage it from there.

Each tier has a different managing option.

- Tier 1: You can edit the payment cycle, invite the bot, and renew it from the dashboard with the preferred payment method.

- Tier 2: You can edit the bot's presence, username, avatar, and status, and as tier 1, you will have the option to invite the bot and renew it.

:::info

- At tier 2, you will have a unique bot number that you will frequently use for special needs

- Premium Tier 2 Subscribers can gain this number in three different ways;
1. Either in the invite page, which you will have a premium bot named in it.
2. After inviting the bot, it will have a premium number by default. That number right after the premium word is your bot number.
3. Typing `/vip info` in your server that has a premium bot invited will also show you the information about your bot, including the number and expiration time.

## Payment Cycle & Prices 

There are two distinct intervals in which we collect payment: monthly and annually.

### Prices

## Inviting Premium Bot

You have to explicitly invite the bot to your server to get access to the premium features.

The inviting process can be done through the manage premium page, which can be accessed via this [link]

:::caution

- Occasionally, premium features will remain locked after inviting the bot to your server. In this instance, the solution is straightforward: either kick the premium bot or both the premium and standard bots and then re-invite the premium bot to your server.

You are free to remove the standard bot after purchasing the premium version.
