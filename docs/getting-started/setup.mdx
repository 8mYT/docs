# Inviting ProBot

Start by inviting Probot to your server via [invite link](https://probot.io/invite).

Then, you may first authorize your account, then select your server, and finally the necessary permissions will be displayed. All essential permissions must be granted for the bot to run effectively.

After inviting the bot, move Probot's role to the top of the server roles hierarchy if you want it to show server roles in some dashboard modules. To do so, go to server settings > roles and hold-click and drag the bot's role to the top of the list.

:::caution

Due to discord, it may still not display roles even after dragging the bot's roles above. To fix this, drag the bot role down, then save and re-drag it above.
