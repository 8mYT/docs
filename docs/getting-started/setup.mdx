# Inviting ProBot

:::info

The following permissions are required to invite the bot to your server; without them, you cannot invite the bot to the desired server.

- `Administrator` Permission 
- `Manage Servers` Permission

:::


1. Let's Start by inviting Probot to your server via [invite link](https://probot.io/invite).

2. Then, you must first authorize your account, then select your server, and finally the necessary permissions will be displayed. All essential permissions must be granted for the bot to run effectively.

3. After inviting the bot, move Probot's role to the top of the server roles hierarchy if you want it to show server roles in some dashboard modules. To do so, go to server settings > roles and hold-click and drag the bot's role to the top of the list.

:::caution

Due to discord, roles may occasionally not appear on the dashboard, even when dragged to the top. If this occurs, drag the bot's role downward, save it, and then drag it upward and save it once more.
