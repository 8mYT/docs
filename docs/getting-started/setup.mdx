# Setup 

:::info

In order to invite ProBot to your server, certain permissions are required. Without these permissions, the bot cannot be added to your server. The required permissions are:

- `Administrator` Permission 
- `Manage Servers` Permission

:::

## Step 1: Inviting ProBot

To invite ProBot to your server, use the [invite link](https://probot.io/invite). This will allow you to authorize your account and select your server

## Steps 2: Authorizing and Granting Permissions

When you invite ProBot to your server, you will be prompted to authorize your account and select the necessary permissions. These permissions must be granted in order for the bot to function properly.

## Step 3: Setting ProBot's Role

After inviting ProBot to your server, it's recommended to move the bot's role to the top of the server roles hierarchy. This is necessary to show server roles in some dashboard modules. To do this, go to server settings > roles and hold-click and drag the bot's role to the top of the list

:::caution

Please note: Due to discord, roles may occasionally not appear on the dashboard, even when dragged to the top. If this occurs, drag the bot's role downward, save it, and then drag it upward and save it once more.
