# Logs

Have ProBot immediately and cleanly log all server actions.

## Settings 

Each log will contain a toggle switch, a log channel, and an embed color.

:::important 

- Some logs may necessitate tier 2 premium storage for performance reasons.

- If you do not have a premium subscription, you cannot view the moderator who took action in the free version.
