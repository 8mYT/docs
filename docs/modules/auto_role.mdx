# Auto-Roles

Have ProBot immediately assign roles to newly-joined users.

## Set up

You can configure auto roles through the module's select menu; choose one or multiple roles as desired.

:::important

You can set a unique link for auto and particular roles if you are a premium subscriber.

1. Select `Add`
2. Then, click the `Edit` button.
3. Insert the invitation link
4. Select the roles you'd like members to have if they join through this invite link.

:::

:::caution

- The bot's role must be higher than the auto-role chosen.

- In response to community requests, if the Discord rule-screen panel is enabled, newly-joined users will be required to accept the rules before receiving the auto role.

- The bot will not assign users roles with administrative privileges.
