# Embed Messages

The rich embeds feature lets the bot send a customized version of your preferred message.

## Setup

You must first click the "create" button to create an embed. Then, you will be redirected to the newly created embed message, which contains a preview that illustrates how the embed message will appear before sending, as well as several buttons, such as send to a channel, edit a sent message, save changes, and cancel changes.

## Setting up embed message

You will see an additional field button that contains all the good stuff, such as the typical embed components 
- Title
- Description
- URL
- Image
- Thumbnail
- Author
- Color
- Footer
- Field 

After selecting the desired ones, you will be presented with a text box where you can enter your text.

## Send To A Channel 

- The button to send the completed embed message to the specified channel.

## Save Changes 

- The button to save the embed's modifications.

## Edit Message

- To edit an existing message that has already been sent.

## Cancel Changes
