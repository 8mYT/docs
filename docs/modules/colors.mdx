# Colors

Create unique, numbered colour names and have your members choose their favourites.

## Setup 

Create numbered named roles such as `1,2,3,4..` with no additional text, and the bot will automatically detect them.

## Color List Title 

The title will appear in the colour image's header; insert any desired text here.

## Color Icon Shape

The square or circle shape of the colour icon in the image.

## Image Background

Configure the background image to be transparent or a custom image, and then insert or upload the image using the option that appears after selecting specific backgrounds.

:::info

Users can only have one colour at a time; choosing a different colour will remove the previous one. To reset the colour, enter the number 0 in the option.

:::

:::caution

- The bot's role should be above the color roles.

- Due to our restrictions, the background image must be less than 3MB.
