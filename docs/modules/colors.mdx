# Colors

This feature allows for the creation of unique, numbered color roles for members to choose from.

## Setup 

To set up the feature, create numbered named roles such as `1,2,3,4..` with no additional text. The bot will automatically detect these roles as color options.

## Color List Title 

The title that appears in the header of the color image can be configured by inserting any desired text into the `Color List Title` field.

## Color Icon Shape

The shape of the color icons in the image can be configured to be either square or circle.

## Image Background

The background image for the color feature can be configured to be transparent or a custom image. To use a custom image, select the option for `custom image` and then insert or upload the image

:::caution

- Users can only have one color role at a time. Choosing a different color will remove the previous one. To reset the color, enter the number `0` in the option.

- The bot's role must be above the color roles in the server's hierarchy.

- Due to restrictions, the background image must be less than 3MB.
